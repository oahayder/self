!! You should delete this section, just read it first !!
Hello and thank you for trying to flesh out your managerial philosophy via Manager README. Below you will find a list of topics you could fill (or delete) with some questions to get you starting. Feel free to delete the questions once you're done.

At any time, you can click on "NEED INSPIRATION?" button next to the "Save all changes" to get more ideas.

This section won't self-destruct, so just delete it once you're done reading :)

1:1s

Personality quirks

Usually, these quirks are not "good" or "bad", they just part of who you are.
