## Motivation for this document

I am a new software manager who wants to get better at managing. I've been an IC my whole career, and how I learned to get better was to increase self awareness and remove biases in my own reviews. We get better by 

## My role
I view my role as setting, and enforcing, expectations in all directions. My direct reports, my colleague managers and my directors. I do that by clearly dictating the following in descending order of priority:

_WHY

Why do we need to do this? Why does it deliver value to our customers? Why is our team responsible for this? 

_WHAT

What problem are we solving? What kind of solution does this require

_WHEN

When does it need to be delivered?

_HOW

How do we make this change? This is the least important to me, since I give my ICs full autonomy in deciding implementation details. They are closer to the code than anyone else and will have the best insight into what will, and won't, work.

## What do I value most?
Enthusiasm and curiosity. If you have those two traits, everything else can be learned easily. Give a damn and question everything.
