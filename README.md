## Motivation for this document

I am a manager who wants to get better at managing. How I've learned to get better in other roles was to increase self awareness and challenge my behaviours. I'm hoping this document can help me better understand my own behaviours as well as exhibiting to others my true self. 

## My role
Maximizing the long-term value add of my team. 

I accomplish this by gathering and enforcing expectations in all directions. My direct reports, my peers and my manager. I do that by clearly communicating the following in descending order of priority:

**WHY**

Why do we need to solve this? Why is it important? Why is our team responsible for this? Having all stakeholders be able to understand and recite this is critical to any project and team success. This knowledge allows you to make quick decisions on your own and keeps you focused on a common goal.

**WHAT**

What problem are we solving? What kind of solution does this require?

**WHEN**

When does it need to be delivered?

**HOW**

How do we solve this problem? This is the least important to me, since I give my teams full autonomy in deciding implementation details. They are closer to the problems than anyone else and will have the best insight into what will, and won't, work.

## What do I value most?
Leadership, enthusiasm, and curiosity. If you have these traits, everything else can be learned easily. Give a damn and question everything.

## Insiprations

[Sapiens](https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens-2/)

Very thought provoking read on the history of humanity. Spurred an interest in anthropology, psychology and their applications in business.


[Extreme Ownership](https://echelonfront.com/extreme-ownership/)

Verbalised a lot of leadership qualities I value most. A fun read that motivated me to be a better leader.


[5 Dysfunctions of a Team](https://de7pikzj4hvyk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/11224029/FiveDysfunctions.pdf)

Industry standard of the foundations of a highly performing and growing team. Not intuitive to me and I find myself going back to study it often.
