## Motivation for this document

I am a new software manager who wants to get better at managing. I've been an IC my whole career, and how I learned to get better was to increase self awareness and remove biases in my self assessment. I'm hoping this doc can help me better understand my own behaviours as well as exhibiting to others my management thought process. 

## My role
Maxaimizing the long-term value add of my team. 

I accomplish this by gathering and enforcing expectations in all directions. My direct reports, my colleague managers and my directors. I do that by clearly dictating the following in descending order of priority:

**WHY**

Why do we need to do this? Why does it deliver value to our customers? Why is our team responsible for this? 

**WHAT**

What problem are we solving? What kind of solution does this require

**WHEN**

When does it need to be delivered?

**HOW**

How do we make this change? This is the least important to me, since I give my ICs full autonomy in deciding implementation details. They are closer to the code than anyone else and will have the best insight into what will, and won't, work.

## What do I value most?
Enthusiasm, leadership and curiosity. If you have these traits, everything else can be learned easily. Give a damn and question everything.

## Personality quirks
