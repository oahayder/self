One of the most fascintating aspects of human behaviour is trust. It's something I think about a lot. 
This may end up being a multi part post. But for now I'd just love to get my thoughts down.

Trust is the foundation of any effective and productive relationship between 1 or more humans. Trust is what markettig orgs spend billions on building with consumers to buy their products. 
It's what makes us follow others. It's what lets us fearlessly deposit our paper money into a machine on the street.


Oxford defines trust as:
```
firm belief in the reliability, truth, ability, or strength of someone or something.
```

The firm belief. However trust is not absolute, it's a gradient. I like to define it in a measurable way:

```
Our trust in an entity can be measured by the probability that we will commit to a large sample size of requests from that entity
```

This is something I think about when working with my managers a lot. I want them to be the most trustworthy people they can be. The more trustworthy they are, the more effective they will be in managing and the higher they will be able to perform. This encapsulates both your influence and leadership, as well as your strategy around your requests. When you request something from someone, without trust our first reaction is defense.
