One of the most fascintating aspects of human behaviour is trust. It's something I think about a lot. 
This may end up being a multi part post. But for now I'd just love to get my thoughts down.

Trust is the foundation of any effective and productive relationship between 1 or more humans. Trust is what markettig orgs spend billions on building with consumers to buy their products. 
It's what makes us follow others. It's what lets us fearlessly deposit our paper money into a machine on the street.


Oxford defines trust as:
```
firm belief in the reliability, truth, ability, or strength of someone or something.
```

Trust is not absolute, it's a gradient. I like to define it in a measurable way, 

```
Our trust in an entity can be measured by the probability that we will be influenced to commit to a large sample size of requests from that entity
```
